# CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT RULES

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MOST IMPORTANT RULE: DO NOT SIMPLIFY

This is very important. DO NOT make new files. ESPECIALLY do not make "simple" versions or "minimal" versions of files. Just fix the errors you see in place. If you add "minimal" files you break real production code and add bloat and larp.

## üö´ BANNED ACTIONS

YOU ARE BANNED FROM MAKING MINIMAL REPRODUCIBLE VERSIONS OF THINGS. YOU ARE BANNED FROM MAKING SIMPLE EXAMPLES.

Your goal is to fix the existing code, NOT generate new files.

DO NOT generate new files. Instead, FIX THE FILES YOU HAVE. FIX THE CODE YOU HAVE.

## üéØ CORRECT APPROACH

- Fix existing files in place
- Modify the actual production code
- Debug and resolve issues where they exist
- Update imports, dependencies, and configurations in the real files

## ‚ùå INCORRECT APPROACH (BANNED)

- Creating "Simple" versions
- Creating "Minimal" examples  
- Creating "Test" versions
- Making new files instead of fixing existing ones
- Adding bloat and duplicate code

## üìã CONSEQUENCE

Not following this rule = you are fired.

This is the most important rule you can follow.
